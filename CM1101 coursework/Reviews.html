                <h4>Borat (2006) <br> Rotten tomatoes score=91% IMBD rating=7.3/10 </h4>
                    <a href="BoratReview.html"> <img class="photo" src='Photos\Borat.jpg'> </a>
                        <p class="text">Borat is the hero of this extraordinary mocu-reality adventure: a film so funny, so breathtakingly offensive, so suicidally discourteous, that strictly speaking it shouldn't be legal at all. He is the naive provincial TV reporter supposedly from Kazakhstan, though it is clear that this "Kazakhstan" is a joke cardboard country, a post-Soviet neverland picked at random, as cheerfully as Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, the spin doctors in the political satire Wag The Dog, once picked "Albania" for their diversionary hoax war. Reportedly, Baron Cohen was actually inspired to create Borat by his youthful travels as a student in the then Soviet republic of Georgia. The character coincidentally resembles Alex, the Ukrainian guide with the bizarre mangled English in Jonathan Safran Foer's novel Everything Is Illuminated. Borat is however immeasurably funnier.</p>

                <h4>Deadpool (2016)<br> Rotten tomatoes score=85% IMBD rating=8.0/10</h4>
                <a href="DeadpoolReview.html"> <img class="photo" src='Photos\Deadpool.jpg'> </a>
                <p class="text">I found myself both enjoying the character and certain gags, while wishing I could skip ahead 2-3 years to see the presumably superior sequel. I really don’t care about how Wade Wilson got his powers and became Deadpool. I’d care more about his would-be romance with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) if the movie gave her more than one great scene.  Wade and Vanessa’s meet-cute, which involves a verbal sparring match over who had the most horrible childhood, is a classic case of giving said female lead a strong opening beat and then sidelining her for the rest of the movie. Yet the picture really expects me to care if Wade can summon up the courage to show off his hideous new face to his former girlfriend.</p>

                    <h4>Pulp Fiction (1994)<br> Rotten tomatoes score=92% IMBD rating=8.9/10</h4>
                    <a href="PulpFictionReview.html"> <img class="photo" src='Photos\Pulp Fiction.jpg'> </a>
                    <p class="text">The least interesting thing about Pulp Fiction is what is in that bloody briefcase. Whether it is unlimited moolah, the soul of Crime Lord Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) or the gold lame suit worn by Val Kilmer's Elvis in True Romance (1993) really misses the point of Tarantino's molotov cocktail of a picture. Making a mockery of the difficult-second-film cliche, Tarantino weaves a patchwork of crime film history into something shiny and new. Peppered with great moments eaten up by actors working at the top of their game (Travolta, Willis and Thurman have never been better, and the film created the aura of greatness that currently surrounds Jackson) Pulp's witty writing, pop culture-surfing, gleeful amorality, cult tuneology and hyperkinetic energy has redefined the crime genre for the foreseeable future.</p>
